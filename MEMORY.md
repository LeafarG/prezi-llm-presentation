# llm-presentation — Project Memory

**One-liner:** Static single-file HTML presentation on LLM history, types, ecosystem (PT-BR). Two Vercel projects (v1 + Prezi variant), both auto-deploy on push via Vercel GitHub App.

## Live

- **v1 (original):** https://llm-presentation-beta.vercel.app — repo `LeafarG/llm-presentation`, branch `main`, Vercel project `prj_vV0D5XkYCUIaNcjvV3Vjl8plmpvJ`
- **Prezi variant:** https://prezi-llm-presentation.vercel.app — repo `LeafarG/prezi-llm-presentation` (standalone, NOT a GitHub fork), branch `main` ← was `feat/prezi-style` in the v1 repo before being mirrored, Vercel project `prj_afadzrtQg2OjZPktLH3S1SiPt0jd`
- **Team scope:** `leafargs-projects` (`team_eXXOxECFjvUEbTXratuOKotI`)

## Local remotes (in `D:\.openclaw\workspace\projects\llm-presentation`)

- `origin` → `LeafarG/llm-presentation` (v1)
- `prezi` → `LeafarG/prezi-llm-presentation` (Prezi variant)
- Current branch: `feat/prezi-style` — the local branch name is unchanged because both repos track the same code; push to either remote's `main`.

## Stack

- Pure static: one `index.html` with inline CSS + JS, no build, no deps
- Framework preset on Vercel: "Other" (auto-detected)
- Node version: 24.x

## Deploy

Auto-deploy via Vercel GitHub App on push to `main`. Initial link done 2026-07-07 via `POST /v9/projects/{id}/link` after boss installed the Vercel GitHub App on LeafarG org. See `D:\.openclaw\workspace\MEMORY.md` 2026-07-07 entry for full link-API pattern.

For manual deploy (rare):
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Critical config

- **No env vars** — pure static, nothing to configure.
- **Vercel CLI 54.14.0** at `C:\Users\rafae\AppData\Roaming\npm\vercel.ps1` — call via the underlying `node ...\vc.js` to avoid the npm shim's stderr pollution (per chat-with-history / rafaelgomes-landingpage precedents).
- **GitHub CLI** at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`; PAT cached as `GH_TOKEN` only when needed (gho_… token has `gist, repo, workflow` scopes).

## Notable gotchas

- **No `.gitignore` originally** — committed `.vercel/project.json` was a non-issue (Vercel-internal), but I added a proper `.gitignore` on 2026-07-07 to prevent future contributors from accidentally committing `.vercel/` updates or editor config.
- **Vercel deployment READY but the `latestDeployments` array on GET /v9/projects/{id} showed `[…]` (empty)** initially right after linking — the first push populated it. Don't panic if it lags for ~10 s post-push.
- **Auto-deploy link via API required Vercel GitHub App installed first** — see MEMORY.md. Don't waste cycles on the token-creation path (`/v3/user/tokens` rejects OAuth CLI tokens with "Cannot create tokens for this app").
- **GitHub blocks forks under the same owner account** — `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/forks` returns `cannot be forked. A single user account cannot own both a parent and fork` when both repos would belong to the same user. The `LeafarG/prezi-llm-presentation` repo was therefore created as a **standalone repo** rather than a fork. It mirrors the v1 content but lacks the GitHub fork-badge link. Functionally identical for Vercel auto-deploy.
- **Project creation via `vercel api /v10/projects -X POST --input NAME.json` works fine**, but the **link endpoint (`/v9/projects/{id}/link`) requires `-F KEY=VAL` form fields** — `--input FILE` returns `415 Unsupported Media Type`. The `/v9/projects/{id}/link` endpoint is undocumented (not in the public OpenAPI spec) but is the canonical link path for the Vercel GitHub App integration. Pattern verified twice (2026-07-07 v1 + Prezi).
- **SSO Protection is on by default for new Vercel projects** (`ssoProtection.deploymentType = "all_except_custom_domains"`). Disable for public previews: `vercel project protection disable <project> --sso --scope <team>`. Same gotcha as `rafaelgomes-landingpage` PR #9 (MEMORY 2026-06-30).

## Updates

- **2026-07-07**: Project shipped to prod (`vercel --prod`, no GitHub link). Per-chat-history pattern applied: SPEC → implementation → manual deploy.
- **2026-07-07 (later same day)**: Auto-deploy enabled via Vercel GitHub App. First auto-deploy commit `chore: enable auto-deploy via Vercel GitHub App` (`205d3ef`) verified end-to-end — push SHA matched deploy SHA within ~10 s.
- **2026-07-07 (afternoon, Prezi variant)**: Boss asked to "make this branch a fork". GitHub API blocks forks under same owner account, so `LeafarG/prezi-llm-presentation` was created as standalone repo (not a fork of `LeafarG/llm-presentation`). The `feat/prezi-style` branch was mirrored via `git push prezi feat/prezi-style:main`. A new Vercel project (`prj_afadzrtQg2OjZPktLH3S1SiPt0jd`) was created via `POST /v10/projects` and linked via `POST /v9/projects/{id}/link` with `-F` form fields (not `--input`). SSO disabled. Boss asked for the Vercel site to mirror the Prezi version while keeping the v1 site at the original URL — both auto-deploy from their respective GitHub repos now. Production: **https://prezi-llm-presentation.vercel.app**. Reverted one throwaway `chore(prezi): trigger Vercel auto-deploy` commit on first push (commit `25d482d`, reverted by `7f92abe`) to keep history clean.
- **2026-07-07 (later afternoon, v2 cluster architecture)**: Boss asked to reorganize the canvas into macro-clusters with intra-cluster transitions. Implemented 3-cluster layout:
  - **Fundamentos** (NW blue): História + Frameworks
  - **O Modelo** (NE purple): Tipos + Thinking
  - **Construções** (S green): Tools + MCP + Harness
  - **Capa** moved to bottom-center as the "synthesis" finale — narratively inverted from the original cover-→-content flow
  - Canvas expanded from 6000×3000 to 6000×3600 to fit the Capa in the south.
  - Each cluster has a canvas-level radial-gradient tint (.cluster-bg.{name}) and a faded Mono label ("// MACRO N · NAME").
  - SVG arrows (.cluster-arrows) connect Fundamentos → Modelo → Construções → Capa (curves go around the frames, no overlaps).
  - Cluster arrows initially pierced the Capa frame; fixed in commit `e00e269` by rerouting Modelo→Construções below y=2150.
  - Capa now has 3 macro-cards (one per cluster) launching **guided tours** via `window.__tour.start(clusterId)`. Each tour walks the cluster's sections with 2.8s pauses + "→ Próximo" hint and "Pular tour" exit button; ends with "Tour concluído" toast + auto-overview.
  - Deep-link `#cluster:fundamentos | modelo | construcoes` triggers tour directly.
  - Commits: `fe83799` (feature), `e00e269` (arrow fix), `ecbcdac` (canvas resize + Capa reposition).
- **2026-07-07 (evening, responsive + Capa trim)**: Boss asked to (1) remove the PC-only media gate so the site works on any viewport, and (2) audit content alignment. Removed the `@media (max-width: 1280px), (max-height: 720px)` block and the `<div class="desktop-only">` overlay entirely (commits `4ea5116`, `862d248`). Trimmed Capa frame from 650px → 500px with `.capa-body` flex layout, `.capa-lead` narrower text (max-width 760px, font 0.95rem), and macro-card padding (0.85rem 1rem 1.2rem). Cluster-bg.capa-area repositioned to match the new frame coords. Site is now responsive from 1280px wide and up (smaller widths show everything but feel less curated).
- **2026-07-07 (evening, cluster hierarchy clarity)**: Boss flagged that the macro cluster wasn't obvious when looking at any single section — the implicit context was lost on focus. Made hierarchy explicit at all three layers (canvas-level, section-level, frame-level):
  1. **Cluster-badge in `.content-header`** of every section: `● MACRO 0N · {NAME}` plus the next-cluster hint (`→ 02 O MODELO` / `→ 03 CONSTRUÇÕES` / `→ CAPA`). JS seeds `--badge-rgb` based on `data-cluster` so the dot/border pick up the cluster color (azul/roxo/verde). Mono font, uppercase, letterspaced 0.12em to read as a status tag.
  2. **Focused-frame tinted border + glow halo** when a section is focused. JS sets `--cluster-color` / `--cluster-rgb` on the section element; CSS uses `border-color: rgba(var(--cluster-rgb), 0.95)` + multi-layer `box-shadow` for a thick 2px ring with cluster-halo bloom. Capa keeps its own pink halo.
  3. **Cluster label on canvas** still visible (faded "// MACRO N · {NAME}") — that's the geography.
  4. **`content-header-row` wrapping** so the badge lives in its own row above the section's // 0N number + h2. Listens to `setCurrentSection` so the cluster-color vars stay synced on every focus. Commits: `ddf207f` (feature), `aa213c8` (amplify tint).
- **2026-07-07 (evening, PLAN v2 — Step 2: interactivity)**: Boss approved the 3-step plan (`docs/PLAN_v2.md`) and asked for step-by-step previews. Step 2 focused on universal click-to-expand + narrative tour + breadcrumb + history timeline dots.
  - **Universal expandable pattern** — factored Tipos detail panel into a `setupExpandableGrid(...)` helper that takes `{sectionId, rowSelector, detailId, panelSelector, backId, deepLinkKey}` and wires up state, animation, ESC, deep-link syncing in one go. Used for Frameworks (3 rows), Harness (4 cards), Tools (9 cards). Detail panels hide the source list via `.dimmed { display: none }` (lesson from Tipos: opacity is leaky, display:none is clean).
  - **Narrative tour mode** (`#tour:narrative` deep-link) — walks all 8 sections in order with longer pauses on dense ones (Historia, Frameworks, Tools, MCP, Capa). Cluster arrows briefly flash `.highlight` between transitions to dramatize the journey. Ends with auto-overview.
  - **Narrative CTA button on Capa** — gradient pink-to-blue button, calls `window.__narrative.start()`.
  - **Breadcrumb in bottom progress** — `MACRO 0N · {NAME} · {Section} · idx / TOTAL`. Was just `idx / TOTAL` before.
  - **History timeline dots** — svg + 13 dots below the section header, one per event-row (auto-populated from DOM). Color-coded (warning/hilight/normal). Click → opens that event's detail.
  - Commits: `fed596b` (universal helper), `37ed759` (display:none for new sections), `9dff6dc` (breadcrumb + narrative + timeline-dots).
- **2026-07-07 (evening, polish — symmetric canvas layout)**: Boss noticed overlapping/non-symmetric frames in overview. Redesigned every section's `left/top/width/height` to enforce uniform gaps and identical widths within each cluster. All 8 sections now sit on a 6000×3800 canvas with: (a) uniform 100-px vertical gap inside Fundamentos and Modelo clusters, (b) uniform 200-px horizontal gap inside Construções (Tools→MCP→Harness), (c) uniform 200-px vertical gap from Construções to Capa, (d) all 3 Construções sections share width=1400 and height=800. Cluster-arrows SVG paths redrawn to fit the new geometry. Cluster-bg gradients resized to wrap each region tightly. Also fixed a long-standing ASCII tree alignment bug in the MCP diagram (the `[ MCP Client ]` line was missing leading indent, breaking the tree visualization). Commits: `b76f8b9` (symmetric layout), `be7c3f8` (more visible arrows), `6ad093d` (MCP tree fix).
- **2026-07-08 (morning, fix pre-deploy route-deep bug)**: At 23:00 the night before I reported finding a bug in the cost-route block — the Python insertion script that added the 3 CEO quotes had accidentally duplicated the entire `<div class="route-step route-deep">` block INSIDE the purple route-action on line 2969, leaving the route-action unclosed (4 opens, 0 explicit close markers). The inner step's `route-arrow` div was also rendered without its `→` content. Fixed with a targeted edit collapsing lines 2969–2974 back to a single clean route-step. Verified live on Vercel: 3 route-action opens, 3 route-step blocks, 3 route-arrow blocks, all balanced. Push `292fcdc..31b6de2` to `prezi/main` deployed cleanly. Lesson: **when inserting HTML by string-substitution, always verify with a `regex.Matches(content, '<div class="X"').Count == regex.Matches(content, '</div>').Count` pass before commit** — see workspace MEMORY 2026-07-08.
- **2026-07-08 (morning, fix custos missing .content wrapper)**: Boss asked "essa card tem capa?" — noticed the ORÇAMENTO thumbnail in overview mode was showing the detailed content (data tables, route steps, CEO quotes) instead of the cover/poster ("Pensar caro ou pensar barato?"). Root cause: the custos section was the only one of 9 missing the `<div class="content">` wrapper around its content-body. Without it, the CSS rule `.content { opacity: 0 }` (which hides content in overview mode) didn't apply, so the content leaked through and obscured the poster. All 8 other sections (capa, historia, tipos, thinking, frameworks, tools, mcp, harness) wrap their content-body in `<div class="content">`. Fixed with a Node.js script that did byte-level UTF-8 patching (the `edit` tool stripped em-dashes on first attempt — reverted, switched to `fs.readFileSync`/`writeFileSync` with explicit UTF-8 + CRLF preservation, verified em-dash count 144→144 and en-dash count 13→13). Commit `5d1394a`. Verified: in overview mode, all 9 thumbnails now show their covers (Custos shows "Pensar caro ou pensar barato?"); in focused mode, poster opacity 0 + content opacity 1 + 3 route-steps + 3 CEO quotes all rendering. Lesson: **the `edit` tool can mangle non-ASCII characters in large files — for surgical UTF-8 edits, use a Node script with explicit encoding, count em/en-dashes before and after, and abort on drift.** See workspace MEMORY 2026-07-08.
